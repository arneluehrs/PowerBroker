#
# This file is a template used by the /opt/pbis/bin/domainjoin-cli
# command to obtain the necessary credentials from PasswordSafe needed
# to execute a PBIS agent domain join.
#
# Using the information provided in this file, domainjoin-cli will
# contact the Password Safe server and obtain the password for
# the AD user account.
#
# The certificates mentioned below are obtained from the Password Safe
# server using the following steps.
#   - Login PasswordSafe web console PasswordSafe_URL/diagnostics
#   - Select Certificates tab.
#   - Select "Export Client Certificate"
#   The generated file is in PFX format which you'll need to convert to
#   PEM format. This file contains the client certificate and private key.
#
#   Convert from PFX to PEM format using openssl:
#   > openssl pkcs12 -in client.pfx -out client.pem -nodes
#     Enter Import Password: <password used to export client certificate>
#
#   Using an editor, edit client.pem and copy and paste the client
#   certificate and private key to the ClientCertificate attribute in this
#   file.
#
#   From the Certificate Authority(CA), obtain a CA certificate and add
#   the certificate section to the ServerCertificate attribute in this file.
